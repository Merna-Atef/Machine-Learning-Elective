1. **The train data set was too big to upload as csv so I have uploaded it with the test as a zipped file (mnist-in-csv.zip). Please unzip it before running the code.**
2. **The training time for all 60000 examples was too long so I only used 15000 examples for train while using all 10000 samples from test** 
3. The assignment notebook contains the solutions and comparisons.
4. The SVM from scratch notebook contains my implementation of SVM.
5. data.csv is dummy trial data for my SVM implementation.
